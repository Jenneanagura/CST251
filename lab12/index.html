    <p> My name is Jennea Nagura, I was raised in Maui Hawai'i, but currently am seeking to start my career in The San Francisco Bay Area. I am passionate about all things Multimedia. I have always loved graphic design and video editing and have recently fell in love with photography. I am hard working, which can been seen in my graduation this may, with my bachelor's degree in Communications from the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa, which I completed in 3 years. Additionally I graduated from High school as a Valedictorian, and will graduate from college with a 3.5 grade point average. These are some of my greatest personal accomplishments, and I hope to add more to the list as my career in multimedia will soon begin. </p>
