	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab was to teach us to create and upkeep
		a neat and organized file structure while coding. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> This lab was simple and lack any true difficuties at least in
		the begining of the lab, for me the extra credit portion of the lab
		is alittle too intimidating to try to do. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> In this lab I was able to create this html page and organize
		my file structure as this screenshots below displays.</p>
